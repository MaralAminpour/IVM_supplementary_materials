It assumes that the data is generated from several Gaussian distributions, each with its own parameters. Let's break it down using the example of segmenting brain MRI based on voxel intensities.\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **The Data: Brain MRI**\n",
        "   - An MRI scan of the brain contains voxel intensities. Each voxel (a 3D pixel) has an intensity value that represents a specific tissue type.\n",

        "\n",
        "2. **Brainmasking and Observing Peaks:**\n",

        "   - The main goal of GMM is to identify parameters (like mean and standard deviation) for each Gaussian distribution (each tissue type in our case).\n",

        "\n",

        "   - For each voxel in the MRI data, GMM will evaluate its intensity and assign it to one of the Gaussian distributions (or tissue types) based on the highest probability.\n",
        "   - Remember the parts outside the brain that were padded with zeros after brainmasking? GMM will essentially ignore these because they don't belong to any of the identified Gaussian distributions.\n",

        "2. Here's the fun part: This isn't a one-time deal. With each feature removed, the model retrains and recalculates the importances. Think of it as a reality show, where contestants are voted off one by one, based on their performance in each episode.\n",

        "2. After that, we find the least important feature and bid it goodbye.\n",

Sometimes, when we use feature selection methods, they might end up choosing just one of these correlated features to represent the entire group. This can be a problem because some of those highly predictive features might not get the recognition they deserve, leading to lower importances for them.\n",

        "**Comparing Feature Selection Methods:**\n",

        "So, in a nutshell, feature importances are like guiding lights in the world of data, showing us which features matter most. But when features are closely connected, we might end up highlighting just one, and that can sometimes overshadow other valuable features. It's all part of the data exploration journey!"
