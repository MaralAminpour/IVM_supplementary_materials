        "\"MLP\" is an acronym for \"Multi-Layer Perceptron,\" which is a type of neural network characterized by multiple layers through which data passes in a feedforward manner. In the recent lecture, we explored how an MLP, also known as a fully connected network, can be trained to classify images from the MNIST dataset. The MNIST dataset comprises small, 2-dimensional grayscale images of handwritten digits, each with a resolution of 28 by 28 pixels.\n",
        "\n",
        "In contrast, the image dimensions we encounter in modern applications can be much larger. For instance, a standard JPEG image might have dimensions of 640 by 480 pixels, with an additional dimension for color channels, typically resulting in a 3-dimensional array of 640 x 480 x 3. Similarly, medical imaging, such as MRI scans of the brain, might produce volumetric data with dimensions reaching 300 x 300 x 200 voxels.\n",
        "\n",
        "If one were to connect every voxel in such large images in a fully connected network, the number of parameters to learn would be astronomically high. For example, a single fully connected layer that connects every voxel from an MRI scan with dimensions of 300 x 300 x 200 would entail learning a weight matrix with around 18 million parameters. This situation, where the number of features dwarfs the number of training examples, can lead to overfitting, where the model learns the training data too well, including its noise and anomalies. Consequently, such a model would likely perform poorly when generalizing to new, unseen data. This is a significant concern in machine learning, as it undermines the purpose of creating models that can predict and perform well on real-world data.\n",
        "\n",
        "Moreover, the utilization of fully connected layers for image data is excessively redundant. Unlike linear regression, which treats each input feature independently, image data possesses inherent structure where adjacent pixels or voxels are often correlated. This spatial correlation is a crucial piece of information that fully connected networks typically ignore.\n",
        "\n",
        "However, it is important to recognize that images are more than just collections of correlated pixels; they can be conceptualized as hierarchies of increasingly complex patterns or textures. For instance, the Fourier transform encoding of magnetic resonance images exemplifies this by decomposing images into patterns of varying spatial frequencies, from low-level textures to more complex structures. This concept is not limited to medical imaging; it also applies to natural images. The hierarchical nature of image data suggests that a different network architecture, such as convolutional neural networks (CNNs), might be more appropriate. CNNs leverage the correlated spatial information and the hierarchical structure of images by using convolutional filters to capture patterns within localized regions, allowing for a significant reduction in the number of parameters and better generalization capabilities."

        "\n",
        "The insightful observation that the mammalian brain efficiently processes visual information has inspired the structure and function of modern image recognition systems. When light reaches our eyes, the captured signals are transmitted from the retina to the primary visual cortex, known as V1, located at the back of the brain. V1 serves as a topographical map for visual stimuli: points that are close together in the visual field are processed by adjacent neurons in V1. The neurons here are adept at detecting edges and other high-frequency spatial features, acting as specialized edge detectors.\n",
        "\n",
        "As visual information progresses through the brain's visual pathway, it is relayed to subsequent cortical areas, such as V2 and V4. Each of these regions extracts and processes more complex patterns, building on the simple features identified by V1. This hierarchical processing is essential, as it allows the brain to handle complex visual tasks, such as object recognition and motion detection. For instance, object recognition involves higher-order visual areas that evolve to represent increasingly complex features until the signals reach the inferior temporal cortex. In this region, individual neurons can be highly selective, responding vigorously to specific objects, like faces.\n",
        "\n",
        "Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are crafted to emulate this hierarchical processing structure. In a CNN, multiple layers of convolutional filters are applied to input images, where initial layers may resemble the function of V1 by detecting simple edges and textures. As the data passes through successive layers, the network identifies more intricate patterns, eventually recognizing whole objects within the images.\n",
        "\n",
        "This layered approach offers a substantial advantage: CNNs do not rely on spatial normalization or image registration. Therefore, there is no need to align images to a standard form or assume that corresponding pixels across different images represent identical content. This flexibility is crucial, especially when dealing with varied image presentations where direct pixel-to-pixel comparison is not feasible due to transformations such as scaling, rotation, or skewing.\n",
        "\n",
        "This characteristic of CNNs is particularly beneficial when compared to traditional machine learning (ML) techniques, which often treat input examples as flat feature vectors, comparing each feature based solely on its position within the vector. This method can suffice for simple, consistent datasets like MNIST, where the images are relatively uniform in size and position. However, it becomes impractical for more complex or varied datasets, such as those involving natural scenes or biological structures, where the spatial relationships and features cannot be neatly mapped onto a fixed vector space without losing critical structural information.\n",
        "\n",
        "Thus, CNNs represent a significant advancement over previous hand-engineered feature detection methods. They allow for the learning of features in a way that respects the intrinsic variability and complexity of the visual world, much like our own biological visual processing systems."

This is where your brain starts to **make sense of all** the lines and edges in what you're looking at.\n",

At this stage, the network has moved beyond the basic 'visual alphabet' and is now 'reading' and understanding complete 'visual words' or even 'visual sentences', so to speak.\n",

        "Let's picture a CNN in action, like a group of artists learning to paint by looking at lots of different pictures of nature. At the very start, the 'layer 1' artists are focused on the basics: they're figuring out how to draw simple lines and edges, the kind of details you'd find in leaves or the ripples of water. The patches you see labeled 'layer 1' are like their early sketches, and the images that get these newbie artists really excited (or 'activate strongly') are ones with these simple patterns.\n",

        "These Sobel filters work by approximating the gradient of the image. The gradient here refers to the rate of change in brightness across the image. In places where there's a sharp change in intensity, like the edge of an object, the gradient is large. The horizontal filter, with its unique arrangement of positive and negative values, highlights areas of the image where there's a significant horizontal change in intensity. Similarly, the vertical filter is tuned to capture sharp changes in the vertical direction.\n",

This convolution process results in a new image where the intensity of each pixel corresponds to the strength of the gradient at that point. So, in the output image, the edges—places where the original image changes rapidly from dark to light or vice versa—stand out as areas of high intensity. This technique is especially useful in many computer vision tasks because edges are critical for understanding the structure and shape of objects within images."

        "   - Example: When you look at a tree, your eyes first detect the **edges and contours** before recognizing it as a tree.\n",

        "2. **Learns Spatial Filters of Increasing Complexity**:\n",
        "   - Explanation: After the initial edge detection in V1, **the visual signals are passed to subsequent visual regions (V2, V3, etc.) **that detect more complex patterns and textures.\n",
        "   - Example: After recognizing edges, your brain begins to notice the **bark's texture**, the leaves' shapes, and how they overlap and form the tree's canopy.\n",
        "   - Relation to Outline: In CNNs, after the first layers learn to detect edges, **the following layers learn filters that can detect more complex features like textures and object parts.**\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **From Edge Filters to Object Detectors**:\n",
        "   - Explanation: As the visual signals move through the higher visual regions in the brain, they become increasingly abstract, and certain cells in the inferior temporal cortex may respond specifically to complex objects, like faces.\n",
        "   - Example: Your brain not only sees a tree but can also differentiate between types of trees, or recognize a face in a crowd.\n",
        "   - Relation to Outline: Similarly, deeper layers in CNNs learn to detect complex objects as a whole, moving from simple edge detection to comprehensive object detection.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **Removes Requirement for Spatial Normalisation of the Signal**:\n",
        "   - Explanation: **Traditional machine learning models require images to be normalized or registered so that corresponding pixels are compared.** However, this is not viable for images with complex variations.\n",
        "   - Example: Imagine trying to compare two pictures of the same breed of dog, **but one is closer to the camera than the other. Traditional methods would struggle unless the images are normalized to align them perfectly.**\n",

        "In summary, CNNs are designed to process visual information in a way that closely resembles the hierarchical, multi-stage processing of the human visual system, starting from basic edge detection and culminating in the recognition of complex objects. This design allows CNNs to handle the variability and complexity found in real-world visual scenes without the rigid spatial normalization required by traditional image processing and machine learning techniques."

        "\n",
        "- **Bespoke Feature Learning**: Unlike traditional feature detection methods, where features have to be manually crafted and chosen by a human expert, C**NNs automatically learn the most relevant features for the task at hand directly from the data.** This process is \"bespoke\" in the sense that it's **custom-tailored**: the features that a CNN learns for one dataset may be very different from those it learns for another.\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Layer-wise Feature Hierarchy**: The architecture of CNNs is designed to reflect a **hierarchy of feature complexity**:\n",
        "   - **Layer 1**: The first layer typically learns **basic visual features, such as edges, corners, or colors**. For instance, if we visualize the filters from the first layer, we might see that **one filter activates strongly for vertical edges, while another might activate for green patches.**\n",
        "   - **Layer 2**: The second layer combines these basic features to detect more complex structures, like simple textures or patterns. The **features at this level are more abstract than in layer 1**, and **each filter has a specific pattern it looks for in the image.**\n",
        "   - **Layer 5**: By the fifth layer, the network has** combined lower-level features** to recognize high-level concepts, such as parts of objects or entire objects like faces or wheels. Here, the feature detectors are highly specialized, and each one may respond to very complex visual patterns.\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Visualization and Interpretation**: When training a CNN, we can visualize what each layer is learning by examining the filters (also known as kernels) and their corresponding activations. For example, we can extract image patches that maximally activate a particular filter to understand what kind of features that filter is representing. This helps in interpreting how the CNN is processing and understanding the input data.\n",
        "\n",
        "- **One-to-One Correspondence**: In deeper layers, there tends to be a **one-to-one correspondence between a filter and the complex feature it detects**. This means each filter is responsible for **identifying one specific**, complex pattern within the input data.\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Complexity and Recognition**: As you go deeper into the CNN, the network **abstracts** more and the features it responds to become representations of whole objects or significant parts of objects. For example, a filter in a higher layer might specifically activate when it sees a human face or the circular shape of a wheel.\n",
        "\n",
        "In essence, CNNs have the significant advantage of **adapting their feature detection to the specific characteristics of the data they are trained on, creating a custom-tailored set of feature detectors that can range from simple to complex**. This adaptability is a key factor in their success in various image recognition tasks."

This is useful in applications where the position of objects is crucial, like autonomous driving systems.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Semantic Segmentation**: This is a more granular task where CNNs label each pixel of an image that belongs to a particular object. In the case of the car, semantic segmentation would involve labeling all pixels that make up the car's image, effectively segmenting it from the rest of the picture. This is particularly useful in medical imaging to delineate the boundaries of organs or in autonomous vehicles to understand the environment at the pixel level.\n",

We can recognize objects, judge their location and movement, and understand complex scenes without needing to switch between different modes of processing.\n",

        "- Much of this research takes inspiration from biological neural networks, particularly the mammalian brain. By understanding how the brain processes visual information so efficiently and flexibly, researchers hope to replicate this adaptability in CNNs. For instance, studies into neural plasticity and how the brain repurposes neurons for different visual functions may inform new artificial network architectures that are capable of similar flexibility."

        "The convolutional operation is a cornerstone of image processing and is particularly effective for feature detection, such as identifying edges within an image. Let's delve into the specific example of hand-engineered features using a Sobel edge detector to understand this better:\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Sobel Edge Detector**: This is a popular algorithmic approach used to detect edges in images. The Sobel edge detector uses two distinct convolutional filters—one for detecting horizontal edges and another for vertical edges.\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Horizontal and Vertical Filters**: The filter designed to detect horizontal edges will have weights arranged to highlight horizontal changes in intensity, whereas the filter for vertical edges will emphasize vertical changes. These filters are typically small matrices (e.g., 3x3) with specific values that are designed to respond strongly to edges in their respective orientations.\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Finite Difference Approximation**: The principle behind the Sobel operator is to approximate the gradient of the image intensity. In mathematical terms, the gradient measures how much the intensity changes in space, which is indicative of an edge. Since digital images are discrete, the Sobel operator uses a finite difference method to estimate these gradients.\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Convolution with Filters**: The actual process involves convolving the image with each of the Sobel filters. Convolution, in this context, means sliding the filter over the image, multiplying the overlapping values, and summing them to produce a new pixel value for the output image. This operation is performed for every pixel position in the image, effectively scanning the whole image with the filters.\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Edge Intensity and Gradients**: The result of this convolution is two new images that represent the gradient of the original image in the horizontal and vertical directions. Wherever there is a sharp change in intensity in the original image, the corresponding pixel in the gradient image will have a high value. Therefore, the edges can be seen as areas with high intensity in the gradient images, indicating places where the gradient—and thus the change in image intensity—is large.\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Resulting Edge Map**: By combining the horizontal and vertical gradient images, an overall edge map can be produced. This edge map highlights the locations of edges in the original image, showing where the intensity sharply changes, and thus, where the boundaries of objects are likely to be.\n",
        "\n",
        "In summary, the Sobel edge detector is a concrete example of using convolutional operations with hand-engineered filters to extract meaningful features—like edges—from an image. This process is a precursor to the more complex, learned convolutions that take place within a CNN, where filters are not designed by hand but are instead learned from data to capture a vast array of features, not just edges."

It involves sliding the filter over the image, performing element-wise multiplication with the part of the image it covers, and summing up the results to form a new image.\n",

        "  - The **Horizontal Filter** (on the left) is used to detect horizontal edges in the image. The positive values are at the top, and the negative values are at the bottom, which means this filter will respond strongly to horizontal changes in intensity—such as the transition from a light to a dark region horizontally.\n",

        "- **Finite-Difference Approximation of the Gradient**: By convolving these filters with the image, we approximate the gradient of the image. The gradient refers to the rate of change of brightness within the image, which is high at the edges where the color changes abruptly. The convolution operation with Sobel filters highlights these areas by producing high values in the new image, effectively outlining where the edges are.\n",

        "Here is the process of applying a convolutional operation, specifically using a vertical Sobel filter, on a small patch of an MRI image of the human brain. Here's an elaboration on the process and the technical details involved:\n",
        "\n",
        "- **MRI Image Patch**: The process starts with an 8x8 patch of an MRI image. This patch has been selected because it contains an edge, which is indicated by a transition from a very bright to a very dark region within the brain structure.\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Sobel Filter Application**: To detect the orientation and presence of this edge, the patch is convolved with the vertical Sobel filter. The vertical Sobel filter is a 3x3 matrix designed to highlight vertical edges by responding to changes in intensity in the vertical direction.\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Cross-Correlation vs. Convolution**: Technically, the operation performed is called cross-correlation, not convolution. In true convolution, the filter would be flipped both horizontally and vertically before being applied to the image. However, in cross-correlation, the filter is used as is, without flipping.\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Relevance in CNNs**: In the context of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), the distinction between cross-correlation and convolution is generally disregarded. This is because CNNs learn the filter weights directly from the data during training, which means they can learn the correct orientation of the filter for the task regardless of whether the operation is technically convolution or cross-correlation.\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Valid Assumption**: Given that CNNs can learn to identify features effectively whether the filters are flipped or not, the use of cross-correlation is considered a valid assumption in practice. This simplification does not affect the network's ability to learn from the data and detect features like edges in images.\n",
        "\n",
        "In summary, the Sobel filter is applied to an MRI image patch to highlight the edges within it, and the operation used is akin to cross-correlation, which is a standard approach in CNNs. This approach simplifies the process without compromising the feature learning and edge detection capabilities of the network."

        "\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Filters as Weight Matrices**: In CNNs, filters (or kernels) are indeed the core components that perform the convolution operations. A filter is represented by a weight matrix $ W_i^l \\in \\mathbb{R}^{f \\times f \\times d_{(l-1)}} $, where $ f $ is the filter size and $ d_{(l-1)} $ is the depth of the input to that layer. These filters are the learned parameters of the network that help in extracting features from the input image.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Imagine Filters as Artisans of Data**: Within the realms of CNNs, think of filters as skilled artisans whose tools are the weight matrices $ W_i^l \\in \\mathbb{R}^{f \\times f \\times d_{(l-1)}} $. Here, $ f $ isn't just a number—it's the size of the artisan's canvas, and $ d_{(l-1)} $ represents the depth of insight they have into the input data. These artisans craftily carve out patterns and features from the raw image data, helping to bring out the essence of the visual information.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Receptive Field**: The concept of a receptive field is important in CNNs because each 'neuron' (or more accurately, each filter application) processes a small, localized region of the input image. This is different from a fully connected network, where each neuron is connected to every input. In CNNs, this locality is captured by the size of the filter, and the receptive field is the part of the image that is 'seen' by the filter during the convolution operation.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Receptive Field - The Window to the World**: In the CNN landscape, each 'neuron' gets a personalized window—the receptive field—through which it gazes at a small segment of the image. It's a departure from the old days of fully connected networks, where each neuron was bombarded with the whole image. Now, our little windows keep things local and focused, allowing for a more intimate and detailed understanding of the image's features.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Parameter Sharing and Convolution**: Parameter sharing is a fundamental feature of CNNs that allows the network to significantly reduce the number of parameters compared to a fully connected network. Because the same filter (with the same weights) is applied across the entire input image, this operation is equivalent to a convolution, where each element of the output feature map is computed by elementwise multiplication of the filter with the input image's receptive field followed by summing the results.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Parameter Sharing - A Convolutional Symphony**: The magic of parameter sharing in CNNs is akin to an orchestra playing in unison. Just as each musician plays the same note in harmony, each neuron in a convolutional layer shares the same filter weights, creating a symphony of convolutions across the image. This not only cuts down on the cacophony of too many parameters but also ensures that the learned patterns are universally recognized across the entire image.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **Output Depth Determined by Number of Filters**: The depth of the output feature map is determined by the number of filters used in the convolutional layer. For example, if you apply 12 filters to an input image of size $ 32 \\times 32 \\times 3 $ with padding to maintain the same spatial dimensions, you would end up with an output feature map of size $ 32 \\times 32 \\times 12 $. Each filter produces a different feature map, and stacking these maps along the depth dimension forms the complete output of the convolutional layer.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Depth of Output - The Ensemble of Filters**: The depth of the output in a CNN layer is set by the ensemble of filters applied. If you're picturing a $ 32 \\times 32 \\times 3 $ image, and you decide to call upon 12 unique filters, you're essentially creating 12 unique interpretations of the image, each capturing different features. Stack these interpretations together, and you get a $ 32 \\times 32 \\times 12 $ feature map that holds a richer, more nuanced representation of the original image.\n",
        "\n",
        "The transition from Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLPs) to CNNs involves understanding these key differences: the use of local receptive fields, shared weights, and the spatial hierarchy of features that the network can learn. CNNs are thus more suited to tasks like image recognition, where the spatial arrangement of pixels is crucial for identifying patterns and features.\n",
        "\n",
        "So, when shifting your mindset from the more traditional neural networks to CNNs, it's like moving from a one-size-fits-all approach to a bespoke tailor-made understanding of images. The CNN approach is more nuanced, allowing the network to create a hierarchy of features, from the simple to the complex, which is perfect for making sense of the visual world."

It follows an identical path, weaving through the grid and capturing its own unique set of features. As it does this, $ W_1 $ decorates the next level of our output volume $ Z $, filling up the second depth channel. So if you think about it, while $ W_0 $ filled up the very first layer of our 3D feature map (that's the zeroth index of $ Z $), $ W_1 $ comes in to add another layer of insights right on top of it (populating the first index).

In the traditional sense, convolution would have us slide the filter over these blocks one by one, doing a lot of multiplications and additions. However, there's a clever trick we can use to speed things up: vectorization.\n",

It's like taking a cube of string cheese and peeling off the strands one by one until you have a neat row. When you do this with every block, you get a tall stack of columns, each representing a piece of the original image, ready to be processed.\n",
        "\n",
        "Now, we perform a similar stretch with each filter, turning what was once a 3x3 kernel into a 9-element vector. Why 9? Because 3 multiplied by 3 is 9, and that's how many pixels we have in each block or filter.\n",
        "\n",
        "Once everything is stretched into columns and lined up, we bring in the big guns of matrix operations: the dot product. By taking the dot product of the filter vectors with the image block vectors, we're effectively doing all the multiplications and additions in one fell swoop. This is much faster than the old way of doing it pixel by pixel, convolution by convolution.\n",

        "The beauty of this approach is that it can be done very quickly, especially on modern computers that are optimized for these kinds of matrix operations. By using this method, we can process entire images with multiple filters rapidly, which is what makes training and using CNNs feasible on a large scale.\n",

        "\n",
        "Suppose we have an input image with dimensions [227x227x3] — a standard size for many classic convolutional neural network architectures. Now, we want to convolve this image with a set of filters that are each [11x11x3] in size. The stride, which is the step we take as we slide the filter across the image, is set to 4. This means that instead of moving our filter one pixel at a time, we move it four pixels over for each step.\n",
        "\n",

        "\n",
        "For each position of the filter on the image, we take the [11x11x3] block of pixels it covers and stretch this block out into a long, thin column vector. This vector has a length of 11 multiplied by 11 multiplied by 3, which equals 363. This stretching is like unrolling a ball of yarn into a straight line — we're turning a 3D block of our image into a 1D column.\n",
        "\n",
        "Now, as we stride across our input image with a step of 4, we don't cover every single pixel one by one. Instead, we jump four pixels each time, which reduces the number of positions we need to stop at. Calculating the number of positions is simple: we subtract the filter size from the input size, divide by the stride, and add 1. For both the width and the height, this gives us (227 - 11) / 4 + 1 = 55 positions.\n",
        "\n",
        "When we do this for both dimensions, we find that we have 55 positions along the width and 55 along the height, resulting in 55 times 55, which is 3025 different positions in total. As we repeat the stretching process for each of these positions, we form a matrix $ X_{\\text{col}} $ from the operation known as $ \\text{im2col} $. This matrix has a size of [363 x 3025], where each of the 3025 columns is one of these unrolled receptive fields.\n",
        "\n",
        "One important thing to note is that because the stride is smaller than the filter size, our receptive fields will overlap, which means that some pixels from the input volume will be represented multiple times across different columns of the $ X_{\\text{col}} $ matrix. This is a natural consequence of how convolution works with striding and ensures that we capture the necessary information from each part of the image as we apply our filters.\n",
        "\n",

It's how we can efficiently process large images with complex filters, making the magic of CNNs possible in practical applications like image recognition."

        "Let's elaborate on how the convolution operation in a neural network can be implemented efficiently using matrix operations. This will involve taking local regions of the input, stretching them out, and then performing dot products with the stretched-out filters.\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Stretching the Image Blocks into Columns**: We begin by targeting specific blocks of the image that align with the size of our filters. Each block is then stretched out into a column. This process, often referred to as `im2col`, transforms the 2D blocks from the image into 1D columns and stacks them side by side, forming a large matrix where each column is one image block.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Stretching the Filters into Rows**: In parallel, we take each filter, which is a small weight matrix, and stretch it out into a row. By doing this with all the filters, we create another matrix where each row corresponds to one filter. The resulting matrix has the shape $ d_l \\times (f \\times f) $, with $ d_l $ being the number of filters and $ f \\times f $ representing the flattened filter size.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Matrix Multiplication**: With both matrices prepared, we carry out a single matrix multiplication using a function like `np.matmul`. This operation effectively computes the dot product between each stretched image block and filter. It's a highly optimized way to do many convolutions simultaneously because modern hardware is very good at crunching these kinds of large matrix operations.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **Reshaping Back into a Volume**: After the matrix multiplication, we're left with a 2D matrix where each element represents a convolution result. To get back to a format that represents the spatial structure of our original image, we reshape this matrix into a 3D volume. This volume has a depth equal to the number of filters, with the spatial dimensions determined by the original image size, filter size, stride, and padding used during the convolution.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. **Applying Activation Function**: Lastly, each value in the output volume is passed through an activation function, like the Rectified Linear Unit (ReLU). This function introduces non-linearity into the model, allowing the network to learn more complex features. It operates on each value individually, typically setting all negative values to zero and leaving positive values unchanged, though other behaviors are possible depending on the specific function used.\n",
        "\n",
        "By following these steps, we can transform the convolution operation from a series of individual computations into a few large, efficient matrix operations. This is crucial for making training and inference with CNNs practical on large-scale data."

When the network is learning, it estimates how much the loss function $ L $, which measures the error of the model, would change with respect to the parameters, such as our weights $ W $. This is where the partial derivatives come into play.\n",
        "\n",
        "Considering the partial derivative of the loss $ L $ with respect to a weight $ w_{11} $, we follow the chain rule, also known as the rule of total derivatives in this context. Since the partial derivative of $ Z $ with respect to $ W $ (for instance, $ \\frac{\\partial z_{11}}{\\partial w_{11}} $) involves the corresponding elements of $ X $, this computation also simplifies to a convolutional operation. Here, the elements of $ X $ are convolved with the partial derivatives of $ L $ with respect to $ Z $.\n",

        "This means that the backpropagation for a convolutional layer, where we're determining how to adjust the weights based on the error, can again be formulated as a series of matrix multiplication operations. These operations are just as optimized and efficient as those in the forward pass, thanks to the regular and structured way that convolutional layers operate.\n",

This ability to learn through backpropagation is what powers the continued improvement of a CNN as it is exposed to more data and more iterations of training."
